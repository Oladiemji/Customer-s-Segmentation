Customer Segmentation Prediction (K-Means Clustering)
📌 Project Overview

This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to segment bank customers based on their financial behavior and engagement metrics. The objective is to identify meaningful customer groups that can support data-driven marketing, retention, and business strategy decisions.

🧠 Methodology

Selected key numerical features including account balance, monthly income, and activity status

Standardized data to ensure equal feature contribution

Built a K-Means clustering model using a reproducible machine learning pipeline

Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and visualization

Assigned each customer to a predicted cluster representing a unique behavioral segment

🔍 Prediction Results & Insights

The model successfully grouped customers into distinct financial and behavioral clusters

Identified high-value customers with strong balances and consistent activity

Highlighted low-engagement clusters that may indicate churn risk

Cluster centroid analysis revealed clear behavioral differences across segments

PCA visualization confirmed good cluster separation, validating model effectiveness

💼 Business Impact

Enables targeted marketing strategies instead of one-size-fits-all campaigns

Supports customer retention and churn prevention initiatives

Helps financial institutions prioritize high-value customer segments

Provides actionable insights for product personalization and strategic planning
